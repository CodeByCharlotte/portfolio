# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I am a student currently working towards my front-end certification, and I've designed this site as part of my coursework to showcase my projects, provide information about me, and offer a way for visitors to get in touch.

## Features

### Hero Section
I've created a simple hero section for now, offering a brief introduction. Currently, it serves as a starting point, and I plan to evolve and enhance it as I progress in my front-end developer course.
### Projects
A section showcasing dummy projects to demonstrate the intended layout for future work. Placeholder images have been used, and I plan to replace them with my actual projects as they are completed.
### About Me
Personal information and background.
### Contact Me
A contact section with a form for users to reach out.

## Contact Information
Email: codebycharlotte@gmail.com
## Functionality
### Contact Me
The contact section functionality is implemented using [form-to-google-sheets](https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets). This allows me to collect and manage inquiries efficiently.
### Dark Mode
My first attempt at using dark mode has been achieved following the tutorial by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wodWDIdV9BY).

## Future Adjustments
The website is designed with a responsive layout. As I progress through my front-end developer course, I plan to continue improving the site. This includes:
- Adding my actual projects to the portfolio section as they are completed, replacing the dummy projects and placeholder images.
- Introducing a "Download CV" button once my CV is available, especially when actively seeking work.
- Implementing other improvements suggested by fellow students or reviewers of the page.

I'm committed to maintaining and enhancing the user experience based on ongoing feedback and my evolving skills.
